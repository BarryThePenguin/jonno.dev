## About

I am passionate about building quality software, with a preference for
simplicity and continuous improvment. I seek to have a deep
understanding of the technologies I use, through continual learning and
engagment with open source communities. I value diversity of ideas
and experiences by building confidence in others, and using my skills and
knowledge to help teams to succeed.

I am currently exploring web standards, distributed applications, and edge computing ðŸ‘€
